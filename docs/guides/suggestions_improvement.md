# List of Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Implement JWT Authentication with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    
    Add secure authentication using JWT, and assign roles (e.g., admin, recruiter) to control who can retrieve or delete candidate data.
    
2. **Add CV Field to Candidate Schema**
    
    Extend the schema to include a `cv` field (file upload or link) to store or reference the candidateâ€™s CV for richer candidate profiles.
    
3. **Link Candidates to Applied Jobs**
    
    Introduce a relationship field (e.g., `appliedJobs`) in the candidate schema to track which jobs each candidate has applied for.
    
4. Implement **audit logging** for actions like create, update, delete (track who did what and when)
5. Add a **status field** (e.g., `applied`, `interviewing`, `hired`, `rejected`) to track the candidate lifecycle
6. Integrate **webhooks or events** to notify other systems when a candidate is created or updated
